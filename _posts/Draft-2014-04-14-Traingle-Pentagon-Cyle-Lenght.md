When you are looking for a peer on LightningNetworkplus, you could either form a traingle or a pentagon. 

3 way channel: Traingle
```mermaid

   ```
5 way channel: Pentagon
```mermaid

   ```

and, there is one more:

2 way channel
```mermaid

   ```
   
I have wondered how different or same it is to open a 2 way channel, 3 way channel and 5 way channel.

### Criterion for Comparison:

We can compare them along two dimensions. 

 - 1st dimention would be how good it is for node operators,
 -  2nd dimentions would be how good it is for whole network.

For node operators, the defnition of 'good' is  succesful routing through the node, and for the whole network the defintion of good is lower payment failure rate for the network.

Considering, we don't have data for either. We'll look for its proxies.

For a node, the proxy we can look for: Centrality measures for the node
for the network, the proxy we can look for : Connectivity metrics, path length metrics, robustness metrics, throughput metrics

### Discussion


The cycle structure of a graph can impact its quality in several ways:

-   Robustness: Longer cycles make the graph more robust, as there are more alternative paths between nodes if some edges fail. Shorter cycles like C3 are more vulnerable.[3](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1490053/what-is-the-difference-between-a-loop-cycle-and-strongly-connected-components-i)
-   Routing Efficiency: Longer cycles can allow more efficient routing, as there are more potential paths between nodes. Shorter cycles may limit routing options.[3](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1490053/what-is-the-difference-between-a-loop-cycle-and-strongly-connected-components-i)
-   Symmetry: Cycle graphs exhibit high symmetry, as any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex. This symmetry can simplify analysis and algorithms.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph)
1.  Complexity: The problem of finding a single simple cycle that covers each vertex exactly once (a Hamiltonian cycle) is much harder than finding a set of cycles that cover each edge. The length of the cycle affects the complexity of these problems.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_%28graph_theory%29)
2.  Cycle Detection Algorithms: The algorithms used to detect cycles in a graph, such as depth-first search, can be impacted by the cycle length. Shorter cycles may be easier to detect.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_%28graph_theory%29)





A traingle is formed when 3 nodes open channels to each other, and pentagon is formed when 5 nodes come together to open a channel. here is an example. 

In the context of the Lightning Network, which facilitates off-chain Bitcoin transactions through a system of payment channels, the topology of the network significantly affects its efficiency, robustness, and speed. Triangles and pentagons, as network motifs, play distinctive roles in how payments are routed and settled. Here's a theoretical exploration of how triangles and pentagons might function in the Lightning Network, along with advice for node runners considering these structures:

### Triangles in the Lightning Network

**Functionality:**

-   **Redundancy and Reliability:** Triangles create redundant paths for routing payments. If one channel in a triangle becomes unavailable (due to closure or insufficient funds), the payment can still be routed through the other two nodes. This redundancy enhances the network's reliability.
-   **Decreased Latency:** Transactions can potentially be settled faster within a triangle due to shorter path lengths between any two nodes in the motif.
-   **Balance Maintenance:** Frequent transactions within a triangle can help maintain channel balances more evenly, reducing the need for frequent rebalancing transactions, which can be costly and time-consuming.

**Pros:**

-   **Resilience Against Failures:** The redundant connections in triangles help in maintaining network functionality even if a node or channel fails.
-   **Enhanced Privacy:** Multiple routing paths can increase privacy by obscuring the true source and destination of funds.

**Cons:**

-   **Potential for Channel Saturation:** If a triangle becomes a popular routing path, it could lead to rapid channel saturation, necessitating more frequent channel rebalances.

### Advice for Node Runners:

-   **Form Triangles with Reliable Partners:** Ensure that channels are established with reliable nodes that have a good history of uptime and sufficient liquidity.
-   **Monitor Channel Capacities:** Keep an eye on the capacity and usage of channels within triangles to manage them proactively for optimal performance.

### Pentagons in the Lightning Network

**Functionality:**

-   **Extended Reach:** Pentagons connect more nodes without requiring every node to be directly connected to every other. This setup can increase the network's reach and potentially tap into diverse funding sources.
-   **Bridge Different Communities:** By linking more nodes, pentagons can serve as bridges between different parts of the network, which might not be as tightly interconnected.

**Pros:**

-   **Access to More Routes:** Increases the number of potential paths for routing payments, which can be beneficial for finding paths with sufficient liquidity.
-   **Diversification of Risk:** Spreads the risk of channel failure or depletion across more nodes, potentially reducing the impact of one node's failure on the network.

**Cons:**

-   **Higher Complexity and Cost:** Managing a pentagon requires maintaining more channels, which might increase the complexity and operational costs.
-   **Longer Paths:** May result in longer paths for transactions, potentially increasing the time and fees associated with routing payments.

### Advice for Node Runners:

-   **Strategic Placement:** Consider forming pentagons with nodes in different parts of the network to enhance connectivity and access to diverse liquidity pools.
-   **Liquidity Management:** Because pentagons involve more nodes and potentially longer paths, effective liquidity management becomes crucial to ensure efficient routing of payments.

### Summary

For the Lightning Network, where speed, reliability, and efficiency are paramount, **triangles** might generally be more advantageous due to their simplicity, redundancy, and ability to quickly process transactions. They are especially useful in dense parts of the network where high transaction volumes are expected.

**Pentagons** might be more suitable for expanding the network's reach or connecting loosely tied regions of the network, offering broader routing options and enhancing the network's robustness through diversification, albeit at the cost of increased complexity and potentially higher transaction latencies.

Node runners should consider their strategic goals, operational capabilities, and the typical transaction patterns of their channels when deciding between forming triangles or pentagons.
